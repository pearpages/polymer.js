# Polymer.js

> Polymer is a lightweight library that helps you take full advantage of Web Components.

> With Web Components, you can create reusable custom elements that interoperate seamlessly with the browserâ€™s built-in elements, or break your app up into right-sized components, making your code cleaner and less expensive to maintain.

> Polymer sprinkles a bit of sugar over the standard Web Components APIs, making it easier for you to get great results.

## HTML ELEMENT

> HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document or web page, once this has been parsed into the Document Object Model.
